To Change the Registration:
1. Edit the File "A320NEO_COCKPIT_MAINPANEL_ALBD.PNG" in Photoshop or any other paint tool.
2. Convert it to DDS (You can use nvidia texture tools for that.)
3. Replace the File: "A320NEO_COCKPIT_MAINPANEL_ALBD.PNG.dds" in your A32NX/SimObjects/AirPlanes/Asobo_A320_NEO/TEXTURE/ Folder.

Keep in mind the original UV is a little distorted, so you might have to play around with that a bit.
